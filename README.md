### To provision the resources in this repository:
1. `git clone https://github.com/Kenny-AngJY/aws-lbc-eks-ingress.git`
2. `terraform init`
3. `terraform apply`
<br>There should be 63 resources to be created.
<br>As no backend is defined, the default backend will be local.
<br>Do wait for 5-10 minutes for the resources to be provisioned.

4. When you want to install the AWS Load Balancer Controller via the Terraform helm provider, modify the default value for the variable **deploy_aws_load_balancer_controller_via_helm_provider** in *variables.tf* to true. Thereafter, apply the changes with `terraform apply`.
<br>There should be 1 resource to be created.
<br>Do wait for 1 minute for the helm chart to be provisioned.

### Clean-up
1. `terraform destroy`
